# SumOfSquares.java
Sum of Squares program in Java

This program calculates the sum of the squared numbers up to the value entered by the user. The program then prints
the value of the sum of squares up to the positive value entered by the user. If a negative number is entered the value
printed is 0. This program does not evaluate for non positive integer values since it is very simple. There is an error if 
an alphabetical character is entered.
